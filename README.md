# 🧥 CSS Exercise – Basic Homepage Layout with Flexbox

Hi there! 👋  
This repository contains one of the first practical exercises from the Cybersecurity Master's program. The objective was to **replicate the structure of a basic homepage using only HTML and CSS**, with an emphasis on **Flexbox layout** and **responsive design**. We were asked to build a simple homepage layout that included:

- A **header** with navigation.  
- A **main** content area.
- A **footer**.
- All layout handled **exclusively with Flexbox** (no CSS Grid, no frameworks).
- The page also had to be **responsive**, adjusting to different screen sizes like mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## ✨ Design Reference: Springfield

For this exercise, I chose to recreate the structure of the homepage of **Springfield**, the fashion retail brand 👕👖.  
I focused on replicating the visual layout and core sections — not the full site, just the main structure and styling using Flexbox.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – To define the semantic structure.
- **CSS3** – Using Flexbox for layout and responsive behavior.
- Responsive behavior was achieved with **media queries** and **Flexbox flexibility**, ensuring a smooth layout across devices.

🧠 I have to admit — **Flexbox gave me a hard time at first** 😅.  
It took me quite a while to understand how to align and distribute elements properly. But after some trial and error, I managed to make everything work smoothly.
This made the project not only educational but also a **real CSS workout**!💪🏻


Thanks for checking it out!🤗
