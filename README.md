# 🧥 CSS Exercise – Basic Homepage Layout with Flexbox

Hi there! 👋  
This repository contains one of the first practical exercises from the Cybersecurity Master's program. The objective was to **replicate the structure of a basic homepage using only HTML and CSS**, with an emphasis on **Flexbox layout** and **responsive design**. We were asked to build a simple homepage layout that included:

- A **header** with navigation.  
- A **main** content area.
- A **footer**.
- All layout handled **exclusively with Flexbox** (no CSS Grid, no frameworks).

The page also had to be **responsive**, adjusting to different screen sizes like mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## ✨ Design Reference: Springfield

For this exercise, I chose to recreate the structure of the homepage of **Springfield**, the fashion retail brand 👕👖.  
I focused on replicating the visual layout and core sections — not the full site, just the main structure and styling using Flexbox.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – To define the semantic structure.
- **CSS3** – Using Flexbox for layout and responsive behavior.
- *No JavaScript or external libraries were used*

## 📱 Responsive Design

Responsive behavior was achieved with **media queries** and **Flexbox flexibility**, ensuring a smooth layout across devices.

## 📁 Project Structure

This was a great hands-on introduction to Flexbox and responsive design principles. Choosing a real-world brand like Springfield made the exercise more engaging and practical.

Thanks for checking it out!🤗
